# 🔗 Azure AD Integration Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide demonstrates how to test the Azure AD integration in your AssetTrack application. The integration allows you to sync employees and their devices from Microsoft Azure Active Directory into your asset management system.

## 🚀 What We've Built

### 1. Azure AD Integration System
- **Employee Sync**: Automatically imports employees from Azure AD
- **Device Sync**: Imports laptops, phones, and other devices from Azure AD
- **Assignment Tracking**: Tracks which devices are assigned to which employees
- **Real-time Updates**: Keeps data synchronized with Azure AD

### 2. Database Schema
The system includes Azure AD-specific fields:
- **Employees**: `azure_ad_id`, `azure_ad_username`, `job_title`, `employee_id`, `last_azure_sync`
- **Assets**: `azure_ad_id`, `operating_system`, `os_version`, `last_azure_sync`

### 3. API Endpoints
- **Azure AD Status API**: `/azure-status/` - View integration status and data
- **Azure AD Sync**: `/azure-sync/` - Trigger manual sync operations

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### Step 1: Run the Test Script
```bash
python test_azure_integration.py
```

This script simulates Azure AD integration by:
- Creating mock Azure AD employees and devices
- Syncing them to your local database
- Showing the results

### Step 2: View the Web Interface
1. Start the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - **Azure AD Status**: http://localhost:8000/azure-status/
   - **Azure AD Sync**: http://localhost:8000/azure-sync/
   - **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8000/

### Step 3: Test the API
```bash
python test_api.py
```

This tests the API endpoints and shows how data flows through the system.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Employee Sync Process
```python
# The system fetches employees from Azure AD
users = azure_ad.get_users()

# For each user, it creates or updates an Employee record
for user in users:
    Employee.objects.create(
        name=user['displayName'],
        email=user['mail'],
        department=user['department'],
        azure_ad_id=user['id'],
        job_title=user['jobTitle'],
        # ... other fields
    )
```

### 2. Device Sync Process
```python
# The system fetches devices from Azure AD
devices = azure_ad.get_devices()

# For each device, it creates or updates an Asset record
for device in devices:
    Asset.objects.create(
        name=device['displayName'],
        asset_type=determine_type(device['operatingSystem']),
        serial_number=device['deviceId'],
        azure_ad_id=device['id'],
        operating_system=device['operatingSystem'],
        # ... other fields
    )
```

### 3. Assignment Sync Process
```python
# The system fetches device assignments from Azure AD
for user in users:
    user_devices = azure_ad.get_user_devices(user['id'])
    
    # Update device assignments
    for device in user_devices:
        asset = Asset.objects.get(azure_ad_id=device['id'])
        employee = Employee.objects.get(azure_ad_id=user['id'])
        asset.assigned_to = employee
        asset.save()
```

## 🌐 Real Azure AD Integration

### Prerequisites
1. **Azure AD Tenant**: You need a Microsoft Azure AD tenant
2. **App Registration**: Register your application in Azure AD
3. **API Permissions**: Grant permissions for Microsoft Graph API

### Configuration
Add these settings to your `settings.py`:
```python
# Azure AD Configuration
AZURE_TENANT_ID = 'your-tenant-id'
AZURE_CLIENT_ID = 'your-client-id'
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your-client-secret'
```

### Running Real Sync
```bash
# Full sync (employees, devices, and assignments)
python manage.py sync_azure_ad

# Sync only employees
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --employees-only

# Sync only devices
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --devices-only

# Sync only assignments
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --assignments-only
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### 1. Automated Sync Scheduling

# Set up automated sync every hour
from django_cron import CronJobBase, Schedule

class AzureADSyncCronJob(CronJobBase):
    schedule = Schedule(run_every_mins=60)
    code = 'assets.azure_ad_sync_cron'

    def do(self):
        azure_ad = AzureADIntegration()
        azure_ad.full_sync()
```

### 2. Real-time Notifications
- Email notifications when new employees are synced
- Alerts when devices are assigned/unassigned
- Dashboard notifications for sync status

### 3. Advanced Filtering
- Sync only specific departments
- Filter devices by type or location
- Custom sync schedules for different data types
