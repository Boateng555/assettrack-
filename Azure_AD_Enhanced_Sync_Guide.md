# Enhanced Azure AD Sync Guide - Complete User Lifecycle Management

## Overview

The enhanced Azure AD integration now provides **complete user lifecycle management** that automatically handles all changes in Azure AD, including:

- âœ… **User Creation**: New users are automatically imported
- âœ… **User Updates**: Changes to existing users are synchronized
- âœ… **User Disablement**: Disabled users are marked as inactive
- âœ… **User Deletion**: Deleted users are marked as deleted
- âœ… **Asset Cleanup**: Assets are automatically unassigned from inactive/deleted users

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ **Automatic Change Detection**
The system now detects and handles:
- **Active users** in Azure AD â†’ Marked as `active` in your app
- **Disabled users** in Azure AD â†’ Marked as `inactive` in your app
- **Deleted users** in Azure AD â†’ Marked as `deleted` in your app
- **New users** in Azure AD â†’ Created in your app
- **Updated users** in Azure AD â†’ Updated in your app

### ðŸ§¹ **Automatic Asset Cleanup**
- Assets assigned to inactive/deleted employees are automatically unassigned
- Asset status is changed to `available` for reassignment
- Prevents orphaned assets in your system

### ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Reporting**
- Detailed sync statistics
- Employee status breakdown
- Asset assignment tracking
- Sync history and timestamps

## Employee Status Management

### Status Types

| Status | Description | Azure AD State |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `active` | Employee is active and working | User exists and is enabled in Azure AD |
| `inactive` | Employee is disabled/temporarily unavailable | User exists but is disabled in Azure AD |
| `deleted` | Employee has been terminated | User has been deleted from Azure AD |

### Status Transitions

```
Azure AD: User Created â†’ User Disabled â†’ User Deleted
   â†“           â†“              â†“              â†“
Your App:   active        â†’ inactive     â†’ deleted
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Full Sync with Change Detection**
```bash
python manage.py sync_azure_ad

```

### 2. **Employee-Only Sync**
```bash
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --employees-only

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Deletion in Azure AD
1. **Create a user** in Azure AD
2. **Sync** to import the user into your app
3. **Delete the user** in Azure AD
4. **Run sync** again
5. **Result**: User is marked as `deleted` in your app, assets are unassigned

### Scenario 2: User Disablement in Azure AD
1. **Create a user** in Azure AD
2. **Sync** to import the user into your app
3. **Disable the user** in Azure AD
4. **Run sync** again
5. **Result**: User is marked as `inactive` in your app, assets are unassigned

### Scenario 3: User Updates in Azure AD
1. **Update user details** (name, email, department) in Azure AD
2. **Run sync**
3. **Result**: User details are updated in your app

### Scenario 4: New User Creation in Azure AD
1. **Create a new user** in Azure AD
2. **Run sync**
3. **Result**: New user is created in your app

## Database Schema Changes

### New Employee Status Field
```python
class Employee(models.Model):
    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('active', 'Active'),
        ('inactive', 'Inactive'),
        ('deleted', 'Deleted'),
    ]
    
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=20, 
        choices=STATUS_CHOICES, 
        default='active',
        help_text="Employee status from Azure AD sync"
    )
```

### Enhanced Sync Tracking
- `last_azure_sync`: Timestamp of last sync
- `azure_ad_id`: Unique Azure AD identifier
- `status`: Current employee status

## API Endpoints

### Sync Status API
```json
GET /api/azure-status/

Response:
{
    "status": "success",
    "summary": {
        "azure_users": 7,
        "local_employees": 19,
        "azure_synced_employees": 13,
        "active_employees": 13,
        "inactive_employees": 5,
        "deleted_employees": 1
    }
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Sync Monitoring
- Track sync success/failure rates
- Monitor employee status changes
- Alert on sync failures
- Log all sync activities

### Recommended Monitoring
- **Daily**: Check sync summary
- **Weekly**: Review employee status changes
- **Monthly**: Audit asset assignments
- **Quarterly**: Review sync performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Users Not Syncing
**Symptoms**: Users exist in Azure AD but not in your app

**Solutions:**
1. Check Azure AD permissions (`User.Read.All`)
2. Verify user accounts are enabled in Azure AD
3. Check sync logs for errors
4. Ensure user has email address

#### Issue 2: Deleted Users Not Marked
**Symptoms**: Deleted Azure AD users still show as active

**Solutions:**
1. Check Azure AD permissions for deleted items
2. Verify sync includes deleted users
3. Check sync logs for errors

#### Issue 3: Assets Not Cleaned Up
**Symptoms**: Assets still assigned to inactive users

**Solutions:**
1. Run cleanup command: `python manage.py sync_azure_ad --cleanup-only`
2. Check employee status values
3. Verify asset assignment logic

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test enhanced sync functionality
python test_enhanced_azure_sync.py

# Check sync summary
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --summary

# Test specific sync components
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --employees-only
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --devices-only
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --assignments-only

# Cleanup orphaned assets
python manage.py sync_azure_ad --cleanup-only
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Regular Sync Schedule**
- **Development**: Sync manually as needed
- **Production**: Set up automated sync every 4-6 hours
- **Critical**: Sync immediately after user changes

### 2. **Monitoring**
- Monitor sync logs for errors
- Track employee status changes
- Review asset assignments regularly
- Set up alerts for sync failures

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Never manually delete employees with Azure AD IDs
- Use status changes instead of deletions
- Keep sync history for audit purposes
- Regular backup of sync data

### 4. **Performance**
- Sync during off-peak hours
- Monitor sync duration
- Optimize for large user bases
- Use incremental sync when possible

## Migration Guide

### From Basic Sync to Enhanced Sync

1. **Backup your database**
2. **Run the migration**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. **Test the enhanced sync**:
   ```bash
   python test_enhanced_azure_sync.py
   ```
4. **Run initial sync**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py sync_azure_ad
   ```
5. **Verify results**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py sync_azure_ad --summary
   ```

### Data Migration Notes
- Existing employees will be marked as `active`
- No data loss during migration
- All existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced features added seamlessly
