# üéì What You Should Demonstrate to Teach Others

## üéØ **Your Teaching Role: Show the Power of Automation**

### **What You Should Demonstrate:**

---

## üöÄ **1. The Problem: Manual vs Automated**

### **Show the Old Way (Manual):**
*"Traditionally, to deploy an application to the cloud, you would:"*

1. **Go to Azure Portal** - Click through web interface
2. **Create Resource Group** - Manual clicks
3. **Create Virtual Network** - More manual clicks
4. **Create Subnet** - Even more clicks
5. **Create Security Group** - Configure firewall rules
6. **Create Public IP** - Set up internet access
7. **Create Virtual Machine** - Configure server
8. **SSH into server** - Manual connection
9. **Install software** - Manual commands
10. **Deploy application** - Manual deployment

**Time: 2-3 hours, prone to errors, not reproducible**

### **Show the New Way (Automated):**
*"With Infrastructure as Code, we can do all of this with a single command:"*

```bash
terraform apply
```

**Time: 5-10 minutes, reproducible, version controlled**

---

## üèóÔ∏è **2. Show the Code: Infrastructure as Code**

### **Demonstrate Your Terraform Configuration:**

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "C:\sal hardwear\terraform-learning"

# Show the main configuration
Get-Content main.tf | Select-Object -First 30
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- *"This code defines our entire cloud infrastructure"*
- *"We can version control this like any other code"*
- *"We can recreate this infrastructure anywhere"*
- *"We can track all changes in Git"*

### **Show Resource Definitions:**
```hcl
# Show how you define a virtual machine
resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "main" {
  name                = "vm-terraform-learning"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  size                = "Standard_B2s"
  admin_username      = "azureuser"
  # ... more configuration
}
```

**Teaching Points:**
- *"This creates a Linux virtual machine"*
- *"We specify the size, location, and configuration"*
- *"We can change the size by editing the code"*

---

## üöÄ **3. Demonstrate Automation: Terraform State Management**

### **Show Current Infrastructure:**

```powershell
# Show current infrastructure
terraform show

# Show all resources
terraform state list

# Show public IP
terraform output
```

**Teaching Points:**
- *"Terraform tracks what exists vs what should exist"*
- *"We can see all 7 Azure resources that were created"*
- *"We can see the public IP address"*

### **Show Infrastructure Management:**

```powershell
# Show how to plan changes
terraform plan

# Show how to destroy infrastructure
terraform destroy
```

**Teaching Points:**
- *"We can see what changes will be made before applying"*
- *"We can destroy all resources to stop billing"*
- *"We can recreate everything with one command"*

---

## üåê **4. Show Application: Real-World Deployment**

### **Show Application Deployment:**

```powershell
# Test connectivity
ssh azureuser@172.171.223.227

# If SSH works, show application
# If SSH fails, demonstrate troubleshooting
```

**Teaching Points:**
- *"The VM is running and accessible"*
- *"We can SSH into the server"*
- *"If there are issues, we can troubleshoot"*

### **Show Web Application:**

```powershell
# Test web application
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://172.171.223.227 -TimeoutSec 10

# Open browser to show application
```

**Teaching Points:**
- *"The Django application is running"*
- *"We can access it from anywhere"*
- *"The application is fully functional"*

---

## üéØ **5. Show the Benefits: Why Automation Matters**

### **Demonstrate Key Benefits:**

#### **1. Reproducibility:**
*"We can recreate this entire infrastructure anywhere:"*
```bash
# On any machine, anywhere
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/terraform-learning.git
cd terraform-learning
terraform apply
```

#### **2. Version Control:**
*"All infrastructure changes are tracked:"*
```bash
git log --oneline
git diff
```

#### **3. Cost Management:**
*"We can stop billing when not needed:"*
```bash
terraform destroy
```

#### **4. Consistency:**
*"Same infrastructure every time:"*
*"No manual configuration errors"*
*"Documented in code"*
