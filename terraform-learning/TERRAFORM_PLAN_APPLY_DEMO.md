# ðŸŽ“ Terraform Plan and Apply Demonstration

## ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect for Your Assignment: Show Infrastructure Automation**

### **What You Just Demonstrated:**
- âœ… **Terraform Plan**: Shows what changes will be made
- âœ… **No Changes**: Infrastructure matches configuration
- âœ… **State Management**: All 7 resources are tracked
- âœ… **Automation**: Infrastructure is managed programmatically

---

## ðŸš€ **Step-by-Step Demonstration Script**

### **Step 1: Show Current State (2 minutes)**
```powershell
# Show all resources
terraform state list

# Show current infrastructure
terraform show
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- *"Terraform tracks all 7 Azure resources"*
- *"We can see the current state of our infrastructure"*
- *"Everything is managed programmatically"*

### **Step 2: Demonstrate Plan (2 minutes)**
```powershell
# Show what changes would be made
terraform plan
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- *"Terraform compares desired state vs current state"*
- *"No changes needed - infrastructure matches configuration"*
- *"This shows the power of Infrastructure as Code"*

### **Step 3: Show Infrastructure Management (3 minutes)**
```powershell
# Show how to make changes
# Edit main.tf to change VM size
# Then run plan again
terraform plan
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- *"We can modify infrastructure by editing code"*
- *"Plan shows exactly what will change"*
- *"We can see the impact before applying"*

### **Step 4: Demonstrate Apply (2 minutes)**
```powershell
# Apply changes (if any)
terraform apply

# Or show how to destroy
terraform destroy
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- *"Apply makes the changes to infrastructure"*
- *"We can destroy everything to stop billing"*
- *"We can recreate everything with one command"*

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Demonstrates for Your Assignment**

### **1. Infrastructure as Code:**
- âœ… **Code defines infrastructure**: All resources in code
- âœ… **Version control**: Changes tracked in Git
- âœ… **Reproducibility**: Can recreate anywhere
- âœ… **Documentation**: Code serves as documentation

### **2. Automation Benefits:**
- âœ… **Time savings**: Infrastructure in minutes vs hours
- âœ… **Consistency**: Same environment every time
- âœ… **Error reduction**: No manual configuration mistakes
- âœ… **Cost control**: Easy to destroy unused resources

### **3. System Administration Skills:**
- âœ… **Infrastructure management**: Programmatic control
- âœ… **State tracking**: Know what exists vs what should exist
- âœ… **Change management**: Plan before applying
- âœ… **Resource lifecycle**: Create, update, destroy

## ðŸš€ **Advanced Demonstration: Make a Change**

### **Step 1: Modify Infrastructure**
```hcl
# Edit main.tf to change VM size
resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "main" {
  # ... existing configuration ...
  size = "Standard_B4s"  # Changed from Standard_B2s
  # ... rest of configuration ...
}
```

### **Step 2: Show Plan with Changes**
```powershell
# Show what will change
terraform plan
```

**Expected Output:**
```
# azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.main will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "main" {
      ~ size = "Standard_B2s" -> "Standard_B4s"
    }
```

### **Step 3: Apply Changes**
```powershell
# Apply the changes
terraform apply
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- *"We can modify infrastructure by editing code"*
- *"Plan shows exactly what will change"*
- *"Apply makes the changes to infrastructure"*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect Assignment Demonstration**

### **Opening Statement:**
*"As a system administrator, I've automated infrastructure management using Terraform. Let me demonstrate how this solves real-world problems."*

### **Show the Problem:**
*"Manual infrastructure management is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable. I've automated this entire process."*

### **Show the Solution:**
*"I use Terraform to define infrastructure in code. This provides programmatic control, version control, and reproducibility."*

### **Demonstrate Automation:**
*"Let me show you how Terraform manages infrastructure:"*
1. **Show current state**: `terraform state list`
2. **Show plan**: `terraform plan`
3. **Show apply**: `terraform apply`
4. **Show destroy**: `terraform destroy`

### **Show Benefits:**
*"This automation provides time savings, consistency, documentation, and cost management."*
