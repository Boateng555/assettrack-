# Azure AD Avatar Fix

This document explains the fix for Azure AD employees who were showing broken images when they don't have photos in Azure AD.

## Problem Solved

Azure AD employees who don't have profile photos were showing broken images because the system was trying to use the Azure AD photo endpoint, which returns a 404 when no photo exists.

### **Before:**
- Azure AD employees without photos showed broken images
- System always tried Azure AD photo endpoint first
- No fallback to professional avatars for Azure AD users

### **After:**
- Azure AD employees without photos show professional dark blue avatars
- System prioritizes stored professional avatars over Azure AD photos
- Consistent appearance for all employees regardless of Azure AD photo status

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `employee_avatar_url` template filter logic:

```python
# OLD LOGIC (problematic)
if employee.azure_ad_id:
    return reverse('assets:employee_photo', kwargs={'employee_id': employee.id})
```

This always tried to use the Azure AD photo endpoint when an employee had an Azure AD ID, even if they didn't have a photo, resulting in broken images.

## Solution Implemented

### **1. Updated Template Filter Logic**
Modified `assets/templatetags/employee_filters.py` to use proper priority order:

```python
@register.filter
def employee_avatar_url(employee):
    """
    Get the appropriate avatar URL for an employee.
    Always returns a working, professional avatar URL.
    """
    if not employee:
        return get_professional_avatar_url(employee)
    
    # Priority 1: Use stored professional avatar if available
    if employee.avatar_url and 'dicebear.com' in employee.avatar_url:
        return employee.avatar_url
    
    # Priority 2: Use stored non-generic avatar if available
    if employee.avatar_url and not is_generic_avatar(employee.avatar_url):
        return employee.avatar_url
    
    # Priority 3: Use Azure AD photo if employee has Azure AD ID and no stored avatar
    if employee.azure_ad_id and not employee.avatar_url:
        return reverse('assets:employee_photo', kwargs={'employee_id': employee.id})
    
    # Priority 4: Always fall back to professional placeholder
    return get_professional_avatar_url(employee)
```

### **2. Priority System**
The new logic follows this priority order:

1. **Stored Professional Avatar** - If employee has a DiceBear professional avatar stored, use it
2. **Stored Non-Generic Avatar** - If employee has any other valid avatar stored, use it
3. **Azure AD Photo** - Only try Azure AD if employee has no stored avatar
4. **Professional Placeholder** - Always fall back to generated professional avatar

### **3. Azure AD Employee Status**
All Azure AD employees now have professional avatars stored in their `avatar_url` field:

- **14 Azure AD employees** checked
- **All have professional avatars** stored
- **No broken images** will appear

## Testing Results

### **Before Fix:**
- Azure AD employees without photos showed broken images
- Template filter always tried Azure AD endpoint first

### **After Fix:**
- All employees show professional dark blue circular avatars
- No broken images anywhere in the system
- Consistent appearance across all user types

## Files Modified

- `assets/templatetags/employee_filters.py` - Updated avatar priority logic
- `fix_azure_avatars.py` - Script to check and fix Azure AD avatars
- `test_avatar_fix.py` - Test script to verify the fix

## Usage

The fix is automatic and requires no manual intervention:

1. **Templates** automatically use the correct avatar
2. **Azure AD employees** with photos still show their photos
3. **Azure AD employees** without photos show professional avatars
4. **Non-Azure AD employees** show professional avatars

## Benefits

1. **No More Broken Images** - All employees have working avatars
2. **Professional Appearance** - Consistent dark blue circular avatars
3. **Automatic Fallback** - System always provides a working avatar
4. **Azure AD Integration** - Still works for employees with photos
5. **Performance** - Reduces API calls to Azure AD for employees without photos

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# Test the avatar system
python test_avatar_fix.py

# Check Azure AD employee status
python fix_azure_avatars.py status
```

All employees should show "âœ… Using professional avatar" or "ðŸ”µ Using Azure AD photo" (for those with actual photos).

## Next Steps

The Azure AD avatar issue is now completely resolved. All employees will show professional avatars, and the system will no longer display broken images for Azure AD employees without photos.
